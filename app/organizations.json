Chimesmasters are typically community members who are experienced musicians. Students are, well, students.

Most of them, from the day they first start to perform, continue to perform until the day they graduate. While this casual membership has yielded us some pretty great chimesplayers, it doesn&rsquo;t help promote the what we do to the&nbsp;majority of campus who don't know&nbsp;about it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>\r\n<p>This RSO, which is the first formal record of chimesplayers, is meant to help us inform the public of what we do and give people the opportunity to join us. The exact schedule for performances will be determined when we have a better idea of how many people are interested.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How to Join</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you would like to stay up to date with our special events, such as \"jukebox\" days and holiday concerts, send an email to <a href=\"mailto:altgeldringers@gmail.com\">altgeldringers@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;stating that you want to receive periodic messages about these events.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At this time time, due to the closure of the tower for repair and maintanence, we are not recruiting new chimesplayers. If you are interested in becoming a chimesplayer once the tower reopens, send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:altgeldringers@gmail.com\"> altgeldringers@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;that briefly explains your interest in the tower and whether you have experience in playing&nbsp;music.

We plan to invite guest speakers who have had stories of both failures and successes, as well as various speakers to elaborate about specific departments in the entrepreneurial world. As our organization grows, we plan to take trips to entrepreneurship forums, workshops, startups, and a trip to Research Park. &nbsp;Hopefully our members that do experience success will return to speak about it or even donate to the organization. This organization is a place where individuals can express themselves free of judgement and criticism.

      "Description": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The China Studies Forum aims to provide an interactive platform for interested students to deliberate and debate about China-related contemporary issues. The rise of China is a unique phenomenon in the 21st century. Its ascendancy not only represents a reshuffle of the existing geopolitical world order, but also appears to be an attractive research and study area. Yet a sense of secrecy and incomprehension still prevails when college students are trying to interpret China-related news and issues, and the UIUC is still&nbsp;lacking a place for student China watchers to exchange thoughts with each other. This forum dedicates to make up this void by holding weekly roundtable discussions. For one thing, the diversity of UIUC is a resource too invaluable to be wasted. For a forum committed to facilitate students&rsquo; understanding of an alien civilization, a diverse composition of participants is an innate requirement. This forum will carry out multilingual publicity, hoping to generate a multilateral interpretation into discussions.&nbsp;The membership includes two layers. Core members are responsible for the daily&nbsp;operation of the Forum and discussion topic preparation whereas discussion members&nbsp;are only expected to engage into weekly discussions. Every week, the Forum will select&nbsp;a relevant topic for discussion based on weekly hot news and it will then pick out one&nbsp;researcher from core members with some expertise in this area to undertake academic&nbsp;studies in this area. No later than two days before the announced discussion date, this&nbsp;researcher is required to send two or three analysis or features and several questions&nbsp;to all members to introduce the general background, different schools of thought, and interpretation of the issue. The discussion will take place at night on a selected day of the week and that researcher is to lead the 1.5 hours discussion. The whole discussion process includes a brief review of the articles being sent and in-depth discussion of the questions raised by the researcher.</p>",

Thus, we see the necessity to establish an association that strives to help them achieve excellence and success in both academic and professional fields. Specifically, CESA aims to perform the functions as described below.</p>\r\n<p>First of all, CESA will build a platform for Chinese engineering students to share their study experiences and resources by collecting resources from students who are taking or have taken different engineering courses in their curriculum. All membership of CESA can use these resources and have responsibility to share their own resources. Nonetheless, we object to pure duplication of homework and projects while encouraging original work and ideas.</p>\r\n<p>Also, through general meetings, activities and workshops, CESA offers members the opportunity to socialize with peer students, build study groups, and share research and job opportunities. In order to make this function more efficient, we will appoint an undergraduate student advisor for each department .</p>\r\n<p>In addition, each semester, we will invite professors from the Engineering Department and representatives from corporations in the field to give speeches. Through the speeches, our members will not only learn the current trends in the Engineering field, but also build network with prospective employers. Moreover, these speeches can be opportunities of researches and internship as well as answers to questions about future study and career for students.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, we will hold some indoor and outdoor activities to enrich engineering students&rsquo; life, such as sports tournaments, weight training groups, paintball, BBQ parties, etc. During these activities, we will also corporate with other student organizations on campus, which will help our CESA members to get involved in American campus life. We do believe that physical fitness is as important as academic ability even for engineering students.</p>",

Membership in the GEO is, and will remain, voluntary.</p>\r\n<p><br /> The GEO strives to be inclusive and open to all graduate employees, operate along democratic principles, act always in the best interests of graduate employees, and act responsibly toward the entire university community.</p>\r\n<p><br /> What We Work for as a Union<br /> By bargaining with the university administration in good faith, toward mutually agreeable improvements to employment policies and benefits for graduate employees, we hope to achieve the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Grievance Procedure: GEO seeks a written and widely publicized procedure for resolution of employment problems. The procedure should be multi-step, protect employees from retaliation, give employees the option of union representation, and include the right to appeal to a neutral arbitrator to make binding decisions.</li>\r\n<li>Workload: the GEO and the university administration should cooperate in addressing the problem of unreasonable workloads in certain departments and move toward greater consistency of workloads across departments. Unpaid job duties should be phased out. However, the union will not seek to limit the right of graduate employees to choose for themselves the time and manner of their work, only to rectify problems of overwork identified by graduate employees.</li>\r\n<li>Health Care: The University should waive the student health insurance plan and McKinley fees for graduate employees. The GEO and the University should work together to improve health care so that it more closely serves the needs of the graduate employee population, and includes such things as a choice of plans and affordable plans for spouses, dependents and domestic partners.</li>\r\n<li>International Employees: The GEO will work for policies that address the specific employment concerns of international graduate employees. The union and the university administration should work together to find creative responses to rules that limit international students to 50% appointments and therefore makes pay increases difficult or limit the types of appointments non-citizens can take.</li>\r\n<li>Stipends: The University should continue improving the stipends of all graduate employees both by increasing the minimum stipend and providing regular cost of living raises. No employee or category of employees should receive a pay cut or freeze in order to fund pay increases for others. The union will not seek pay caps or limits on departments&rsquo; ability to offer higher salaries.</li>\r\n<li>A Good Work Environment for All: Recognizing that a work environment free from hostility and discrimination is a necessary prerequisite for improving the quality of education and research at the UI, the GEO will work to strengthen and enforce university policies against discrimination and sexual harassment.</li>\r\n<li>Tuition Waivers: The University should restore full tuition waivers for all graduate employees regardless of program status. Employees with less than 25% FTE appointments should receive partial waivers. Graduate hourly employees whose work exceeds 10 hours a week on average should receive a full waiver.</li>\r\n<li>Paid Training: Graduate employees new to an assistantship should receive paid job training. If a graduate employee&rsquo;s job description includes work in hazardous settings (which include, e.g., exposure to chemical, radiation, or biological hazards), the employee should be paid to attend formal safety training programs.</li>\r\n<li>Family Issues: The GEO is committed to making affordable child care a goal of the University and supports University subsidized child care for all employees. The GEO and the University administration should work together to establish a feasible child care plan for graduate employees with children.</li>\r\n<li>Workplace Safety: The University will observe all applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety. No employee should be forced to work under conditions that violate safety laws. GEO representatives should serve on all University and Departmental committees on workplace safety.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Together they recognized the desperate need for decent housing among the poor of southwestern Georgia and envisioned the partnership that became Habitat for Humanity International. Since its founding in 1976, Habitat has grown rapidly and now includes more than 1400 U.S. affiliates in Habitat USA and over 100 projects in 30 other countries sponsored by Habitat International. Over 100,000 Habitat houses have been built. Among Habitat's many volunteers and supporters is former President Jimmy Carter. Local organizing efforts began with a few individuals in December 1990. In December 1991, Habitat for Humanity of Champaign and Piatt Counties (HHCPC) became an official affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International. Our UIUC Student Chapter began that Spring of 1992, and became an official chapter with Habitat for Humanity International in March of 1993.</p>\r\n<h4>WHAT DOES HABITAT FOR HUMANITY DO?</h4>\r\n<p>Habitat USA and Habitat International are ecumenical Christian housing ministries that seek to eliminate poverty housing and homelessness worldwide. Everywhere we work, Habitat builds new relationships and a sense of community as well as new housing. Habitat also improves the local community by putting property back on the tax rolls and by adding life to older neighborhoods Through volunteer labor, careful management, and donations of money and materials, Habitat builds and rehabilitates simple, decent homes so they are affordable for low-income families currently living in substandard housing. Houses are sold to these partner families at cost, through no-interest mortgages. Each family's house payments go into a revolving fund to help pay for the construction of other houses. Construction of Habitat homes is a cooperative effort between volunteers and the future home owners. This reduces the cost of the home, increases the pride of ownership, and fosters the development of positive relationships.</p>\r\n<h4>OUR GOALS</h4>\r\n<p>Our University's Chapter works with the Champaign County Chapter of Habitat to end poverty housing right here in Champaign. Since starting in 1992, the students have sponsored and helped complete 8 houses. When not working on a house, the students fundraise, plan events and volunteer projects to connect with local Habitat families, and raise awareness about poverty housing. During spring break we also send trips to different states to build with Habitat.</p>\r\n</div>",

Illini Friendships provides volunteer opportunities for students of the university while positively impacting senior citizens in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and elsewhere within the Champaign-Urbana community. The goal of the Illini Friendships is to facilitate the creation of friendships between senior citizens and students while also improving and maintaining the cognitive health of senior citizens with mental illness and disease. A secondary function of Illini Friendships will be to raise awareness and to educate members and the community on mental illness and disease occurring in the&nbsp;older population. Another function of the club will be to fundraise for the local nursing homes. Money collected will be used to help improve the quality of care given at the nursing homes. In addition, the club will fundraise and raise awareness for neurological illnesses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Nursing homes and assisted living communities are often understaffed. Residents of these facilities are often left alone with nothing to do, some residents talk to others while others sit alone in silence. The nursing assistants of the nursing homes can become overworked and too busy to give the needed attention to the residents. This is where Illini Friendships can step in. Students can travel to nursing homes/assisted living communities and spend time quality time with the residents. Illini Friendships provides students the opportunity to&nbsp;get to know the residents and to hear their stories while also sharing&nbsp;their own. Students will be able to engage in activities&nbsp;with the residents such as&nbsp;playing games like&nbsp;checkers, chess, bingo, and etc.</p>\r\n<p>Illini Friendships will meet once every two weeks on campus at a time and date to be determined. The club will offer weekly volunteer opportunities for its members. At the club meetings students will discuss and share their experiences with&nbsp;each other. Additionally, short lectures will be given during meetings discussing neurological illnesses. These lectures will focus on illnesses that often affect the elderly population such as: parkinson's, dementia, alzheimer's, depression, and etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The club is intended for any and all&nbsp;students at U of I. The club offers an opportunity for pre-health students to gain volunteer opportunities as well as to gain experience interacting with an aging population, one in which they will most certainly be caring for.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Elements in synchronized skating include blocks, circles, wheels, lines, intersections, moves in the field, moves in isolation, no-hold blocks, spins, and pairs moves.

      "Description": "<p>Today nearly everyone recognizes the importance of knowing everything possible about communication. Information technologies, media mergers and computer marvels are daily convention. However, intellectually significant research and its associated pedagogical issues on communication is not commonplace. Work of enduring quality develops from comprehending the gravity and stature of the subject&mdash;and communication is among the most challenging and fascinating areas that humankind has been inspired to address. Additionally, research in this area must extend outside of pure intellectual endeavors and into understandings of our everyday lives and practices. In this vein, the ICR Grad Student Organization is dedicated to the facilitation of research and pedagogy of contemporary communications, media, and critical/cultural studies both through intellectual inquiry and practical understandings of the ways in which these forces shape our everyday lives. The organization has been created with two main goals in mind:</p>\r\n<p>1) To involve the broader UIUC community to the critical issues surrounding&nbsp;media economics, organization and structure; media policy; political economy of the media; new technologies and new media; telecommunications; advertising and consumer research; media ethics, media and communications history; social and cultural studies of science and medicine; popular culture and film; race ethnicity and gender; democracy and the media; and global/international communications. This involvement can include public lectures on cutting-edge issues, practical workshops on media technologies/production, seminars on pedagogical development and trends, and strategies for integrating theoretical and critical inquiry into the development of personal and professional skills.</p>\r\n<p>2) To facilitate the networking and interpersonal relationships of ICR graduate students, as representative of the UIUC intellectual tradition, into to broader professional community of communications and media scholars.</p>\r\n<p>With one of the most renowned communications Ph.D. programs in the world, ICR grad students are uniquely positioned to work to advance these goals. As such, the ICR Grad Student Organization is dedicated to crossing the boundaries of established academic disciplines, drawing on a holistic intellectual heritage grounded in liberal arts, the traditions of social scientific research and cultural interpretation, a thorough spirit of critical inquiry, and a commitment to extending the intellectual into the everyday. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Our Alumni Division then provides a forum in which brothers may apply these beliefs and become true leaders of society.

      "Description": "<p>We are a group of students at the University of Illinois that is hosting a STEM based youth seminar, Illinois NOVAREE, in the spring semester. We&rsquo;ve had positive feedback from youths, and parents in our first two years and we&rsquo;ve decided to create an RSO so that local youth can enjoy this clinic for years to come! Many of our participants never knew that hands-on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) could be so much fun! Our mission is to excite local youth about STEM and to encourage them to pursue careers in these fields.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A wide range of STEM classes&mdash;including aviation, robotics, chemistry, radio, railroading, architecture, and so much more&mdash;are taught by University of Illinois students who are thrilled to share their love of STEM subjects with young people. As University of Illinois students, we have access to wonderful resources that enrich our program. Members of the NOVAREE RSO can expect to not only partake in volunteering but also help expand the NOVAREE each year.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The curriculum is designed to engage and excite everyone&mdash;even those who don&rsquo;t love STEM subjects at school.&nbsp;These classes are designed around the Boy Scout merit badge/Nova awards, and the Girl Scouts Imagine awards. Our classes thus offer the opportunity for participating boy scouts and girl scouts to earn their respective merit badges, as we are affiliated with the Prairie Lands Council (Boy Scouts Council 172) and the local Girl Scout chapter; however, we are looking to expand our demographic beyond just the boy scouts and girl scouts in the upcoming years.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We are a non-profit organization; however, we do charge a small registration fee for participants of the event to pay for direct expenses incurred such as materials used in the classes, event patches, and volunteer t-shirts. We have been careful to keep registration costs to a minimum, so no students are excluded.&nbsp;NOVAREE&rsquo;s success in its first two years has inspired us to reach out to more students, to provide more young people with this amazing opportunity to engage in interactive STEM learning on a world-ranked university campus.</p>",
      "Summary": "Novaree is an organization dedicated to STEM outreach to middle school and high school aged youth. In recent years NOVAREE has partnered with the numerous RSOs on campus to host a STEM based outreach clinic on campus. ",

However, in this club, we are going to inform students the information of various shelters in Champaign and teach them how to adopt pets. Also, we will hold some activities to let people be familiar with shelter animals. Let them see that shelter animals are also as healthy and cute as the pets sold in pet stores.</p>\r\n<p>The reason we hold this club is also encouraging people to adopt rather than buy pets in store, because buying pets can promote puppy mills to grow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Besides, our club will provide service for those who do not want to trouble themselves to go to shelter to adopt pets. We are going to help them with the process and&nbsp;contact shelters for them.</p>",

In addition, they believed that such an organization could foster cooperation between the students and faculty to promote worthwhile student activities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\" />\r\n<ul style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 2em 3em;\">\r\n<li style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">The Illinois Alpha chapter has continued to perform these functions continuously since its inception.

      "Description": "<p>Prime was conceived in the spring semester of 2013, when our founders realized that there was a significant educational gap between the academic curricula in the College of Business and the skills and experiences that employers in the investment banking and consulting industries looked for in candidates. While programs like the Golder Academies, the Market Information Lab, and student organizations addressed this issue, there was still a paucity of opportunities for younger students (freshmen and sophomores). Prime was created to bridge that gap and provide these younger students a springboard for their careers.</p>\r\n<p>Prime provides a comprehensive introduction to mergers and acquisitions by simulating a deal throughout the course of a semester, augmented by strong curriculum and guest speakers from industry. In weekly meetings, we cover topics ranging from corporate finance, valuation, and deal structuring, to market evaluation, firm strategy, and post-merger integration. Guest speakers connect these lessons to real life scenarios and provide additional insight - we've had professionals from PwC, William Blair, and J.P. Morgan, and Citi speak so far.</p>\r\n<p>The semester-long simulation serves as the core of the Prime experience. Students form teams for 4-5 students, and play the role of investment bankers advising clients in M&amp;A situations. Throughout the course of the semester, the deal unfolds under the guidance of the student advisor teams, in tandem with topics and situations covered in the curriculum portion of the program. This allows students to build teamworking, negotiation, and communication skills in addition to learning content.</p>",

Our sorority addresses this issue through leadership, outreach, individual, community interaction, and most importantly, the bonds of sisterhood. The sorority also promotes development among its members, the students and the faculty at each of the campuses we represent. In order to achieve this goal, we partake in political, social, educational, and cultural activities. Each effort improves our environment, and instills within our sisters experiences that will follow them long after they&rsquo;ve graduated. Through a network of like-minded yet highly individualistic women, the sorority lends structure and support to sorors that share this Sigma vision. We believe the strength of our foundation derives from the unity of sisterhood, one that was proudly established years ago. In addition, we work in collaboration with other Greek and non-Greek organizations to provide services for the local communities and the community at large. It is through our various participations in these cultural events, educational workshops, and philanthropic support that we make a difference. Nationally, regionally, and individually, we strive to embody the ideals of Sigma Psi Zeta.</p>\r\n<p>As a Student Organization on campus that raises Asian/Asian-American awareness, we are also an affiliate of the Asian Pacific American Coalition (APAC):&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uiucapac.org/\">http://www.uiucapac.org/</a></p>\r\n<p>Follow us on Facebook:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/uiuc.sigmas?fref=ts\">https://www.facebook.com/uiuc.sigmas?fref=ts</a></p>\r\n<p>Check out our website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uiucsigmapsizeta.org/\">http://www.uiucsigmapsizeta.org/</a></p>\r\n<p>National Sigma Psi Zeta Sorority Inc. website:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://sigmapsizeta.org/\">http://sigmapsizeta.org/</a></p>",

One example of our clientele are international students (F or J Visa status) who receive stipends at the university. Every year, all our members get certified in basic and intermediate section certification for VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) by the IRS. Also, all our founding members successfully completed tax preparer training sessions at Center for Economic Progress Organization. Based on that, our executive board members hold seminars in the fall semesters to discuss issues related to taxes, accounting, and finance, and the volunteer services that we provide in the spring semesters. In the spring semesters, we provide one-on-one client service in assisting them with their individual tax returns (1040, 1040 NR, etc.).<br /> TACS is a professional and friendly organization that is open to all the students on campus and all members in the Champaign area.</p>",

That $1 that might not mean much to you or I could be used to help buy a meal for a hungry person in our community. This RSO is focused on helping needy people in our community by meeting a financial need that they may have (i.e. buying food, clothes, etc). By doing this, we aim to build relationships with those less fortunate and be a friend to them as well. Many of the homeless people in Champaign-Urbana are ignored by most of the population. People pretend they are invisible and just walk right past. This is dehumanizing and cruel. My goal is to let these people know that they are cared about and valued as people, and we want to show them this through the investment of small, individual monetary contributions pooled together to buy something they have a need for as well as the investment of time and being a friend in any way we can.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_p1\">We want to build relationships with those less fortunate in our community, which requires more than just a one time &ldquo;good deed.&rdquo; To facilitate this, members of this RSO will try and buy a meal for and spend time with the same person on a weekly basis in teams of around 5. While some would argue that more people would be helped if we focused on more people for a smaller amount of time, we value really getting to know one person over just buying a meal for someone one time and never seeing them again. <span class=\"x_x_Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>As our group grows, this will allow us to reach more and more people.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_p1\">This RSO will also participate in various fundraisers going toward various causes. One of these fundraisers will be take place next fall to buy warm winter coats for those who cannot afford them. As needs become evident, fundraisers will be held to meet those needs. These can have broad targets (like buying as many coats as possible and distributing them/donating them) or more narrow targets (like meeting a specific need i.e. taking 1 family grocery shopping).</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_p1\">This RSO would like to volunteer periodically in homeless shelters in Champaign-Urbana as well as with the Salvation Army.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_p1\">This RSO&rsquo;s primary focus is on needy people in Champaign-Urbana, but is not limited to this. We also have an interest in working with Misericordia, a home for children and adults with disabilities located in Chicago. Some of our group members have loved ones that are very involved with Misericordia, and we would like to be involved in assisting that organization as a secondary goal.</p>",

Vedanta affirms the oneness of existence, the divinity of the soul, and the harmony of religions. The idea of harmony of religions is expressed in one of the earliest Vedantic texts &mdash; ekam sat viprā bahudhā vadanti (&ldquo;Truth is one, sages call it by var&shy;i&shy;ous names&rdquo;) (Rig Veda). Vedanta is the philosophical foundation of Hinduism; but while Hinduism includes aspects of Indian culture, Vedanta is universal in its application and is equally relevant to all countries, all cultures, and all religious backgrounds.<br /> <br /> At Vedanta Study Circle, we are dedicated to learn, understand and practice Vedanta as taught by Swami Vivekananda, one of the foremost Vedantins of modern times. A Vedantin can profess any religion. He/she can be a Hindu or a christian&nbsp;or a&nbsp;Muslim or a Jew or a Buddhist or a Sikh or a Jain or can even be an atheist. So, VSC is open to everyone irrespective of their race, nationality, gender, religion etc.<br /> <br /> Activities<br /> Our primary activity is a weekly study meeting, where we read, discuss, debate and understand Vedanta. This is the first step in practicing Vedanta.</p>\r\n<p>Find up-to-date details about our activities on our facebook page&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/illini.vedanta/<br /> <br /> We will also have a few 'outreach events' topics will be of interest to broader student community. These talks will be given by invited speakers including Swami Ishatmananda.<br /> <br /> <br /> Vivekananda<br /> Swami Vivekananda is the first Hindu Monk and preacher in the west. He represented Hinduism at the Parliament of Religions, held as part of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, where he was an instant success. Subsequently he was invited to speak all over America and Europe. He was a man with a great spiritual presence and tremendous intellect.<br /> <br /> He strove to promote peace and human brotherhood on the spiritual foundation of the Vedantic Oneness of existence. A mystic of the highest order, Vivekananda had a direct and intuitive experience of Reality. He derived his ideas from that unfailing source of wisdom and often presented them in the soul-stirring language of poetry. The natural tendency of Vivekananda's mind, was to soar above the world and forget itself in contemplation of the Absolute. But another part of his personality bled at the sight of human suffering. He chose, in obedience to a higher call, service to man as his mission.</p>",
